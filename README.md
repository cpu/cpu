I'm Daniel (@cpu).

🛠️💕 I like: Rust, applied cryptography, Go, mountain bikes, ACME, computer security, mushrooms, Nix/NixOS, death|black metal, Linux, free software, skateboards, DNS, emoji, snowboards, Wireguard, living in the woods, MUDs, LPC, & reading other people’s dev logs.

🚧🏗️ I'm a full-time open source developer and maintainer. I helped make [ACME] and I’ve contributed to free software like [Rustls], [Go], [HickoryDNS], [Boulder], [ZLint], [curl] and many other free software projects.

🕰️🦀 Recently: I've been splitting my time between working for [Geomys] on Go cryptography, contracting, and volunteering in the [Rustls ecosystem].
